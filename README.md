Coaster Project 🚀🎢

Welcome to the Coaster Project repository! This project offers an in-depth analysis of roller coasters from around the world. Leveraging Python and data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, we dive into a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of roller coasters. Whether you're a thrill-seeker or a data enthusiast, this project provides fascinating insights into the exciting world of roller coasters.

🌟 What's Inside?

Data Exploration & Cleaning 🧹
We start by loading and examining the dataset to understand its structure and key attributes:

Coaster_Name: Name of the roller coaster.
Length, Speed, Height: Physical attributes of the coaster, including length, speed (in mph), and height (in ft).
Location, Status: Geographic location and operational status of the coaster.
Opening Date: The date when the coaster opened, cleaned for analysis.
Type_Main: Type of coaster (e.g., Wood, Steel).
Year Introduced: Year the coaster was introduced.

Features:

Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
Renaming columns for clarity and consistency.
Removing duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Understanding the Data Through Visualizations 📊
This section includes various visualizations to reveal trends and patterns:

Top 10 Years Coasters Introduced: A bar chart showing the most common years roller coasters were introduced.
Coaster Speed Distribution: A histogram illustrating the distribution of coaster speeds.
Speed vs. Height: A scatter plot comparing coaster speed and height.
Speed vs. Height by Year: A scatter plot with color coding by the year introduced.
Pairwise Relationships: A pairplot exploring relationships between year introduced, speed, height, inversions, and G-force.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap showing correlations between key attributes.

Advanced Insights 🕵️‍♂️
Going beyond basic visualizations to uncover deeper insights:

Average Coaster Speed by Location: A bar chart displaying the average speed of coasters by location, highlighting regions with faster coasters.

Feel free to explore the code, generate your own visualizations, and gain insights from this dynamic dataset. Contributions and suggestions for further analysis are always welcome!
